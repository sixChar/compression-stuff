This repo contains code written to teach myself, and play around with, compression.

The algorithms will be tested on a small portion (1 GiB) of the enwik9 dataset and a random bitmap image, neither of which are included in this repo.

Implemented so far:
- Transform image so RGB channels are kept together
- Move to front transform
- Run length encoding
- Huffman coding with basic counting probabilities
